					</h1>
					<div className="how-it-works-content">
						<p>
							Deep Fungible Value is a free tool for collectors to browse and
							analyze the 'rarity' of NFTs and traits within a collection.
						</p>
						<p>
							Deep Fungible Value was created by a few enthusiastic GameStop NFT
							collectors who wanted to help enhance the budding GameStop NFT
							Marketplace ecosystem. We are in no way affiliated with GameStop.

						[] Why does NFT rarity matter?
					</h1>
					<div className="how-it-works-content">
						<p>
							Rarity is the reason that one NFT can sell for 10x more than
							another NFT in the same collection. Similar to traditional
							collectibles like trading cards or sports memorabilia, NFTs with
							traits that are uncommon within the collection can be considered
							'rarer' which can increase the value. If you own the only signed,
							mint condition Michael Jordan rookie card in the world, it'll be
							worth more than a beat up Larry Bird card signed by Danny Devito.
						</p>
						<p>
							Without access to these stats, it can be very hard to accurately
							value an NFT, especially when collection supply gets into the
							thousands. Deep Fungible Value provides a free and easy way to
							guage NFT rarity within a collection.

					<h1 className="how-it-works-header">ðŸ§® Attribute Rarity Scoring</h1>
					<div className="how-it-works-content">
						<p>
							To find the rarity of an NFT, you have to start with the
							collection's traits. Each trait is given a 'rarity score' based on
							how many NFTs in the collection have that trait and dividing it by
							the total number of NFTs in that collection.
						</p>
						<p>
							To remain unbiased, we have not taken any liberties to give a
							greater weight to certain traits/categories over others, even if
							they seem like they
							<em> should </em> be rarer. If you're affiliated with a GameStop
							NFT collection and would like to discuss custom rarity scoring,
							please{" "}

					<h1 className="how-it-works-header">ðŸ“ˆ NFT Rarity Ranking</h1>
					<div className="how-it-works-content">
						<p>
							Once a rarity score has been calculated for each trait in a
							collection, a 'total rarity score' is given to each NFT by taking
							the sum of their trait's rarity scores. NFTs are then ranked
							within their collection based on that total rarity score. NFTs
							with the exact same total rarity score (typically only the case
							with 1/1's) are marked as a tie.

							There are some collections in GameStop's NFT Marketplace that have

							</a>{" "}
							for example. Although this only affects a handful of NFTs, these
							collections may display inaccurate rarity rankings as a result.
							The goal was to create an optimal user experience while still
							maintaining an unbiased rarity ranking system. In other words, no
							assumptions as to the intentions of the creator(s) when it comes
							to rarity ranking, but we did hide some of the 'wonky'
							categories/traits from the filtering options to keep things clean.
							These collections have been marked with a yellow 'Metadata Note'
