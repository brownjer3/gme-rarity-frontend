						üíé Why Does NFT Rarity Matter?
					</h1>
					<div className="how-it-works-content">
						<p>
							NFT rarity refers to how common or uncommon an NFT is within a
							collection. Generally speaking, NFTs with traits that are commonly
							seen throughout a collection are considered less rare, whereas
							NFTs with more unique/uncommon traits are rarer. For collectors,
							the rarity of an NFT can increase the value of certain NFTs and
							help guide their collection strategy.
						</p>
						<p>
							Rarity is the reason that one NFT can sell for millions while
							another NFT in the very same collection sells for a fraction of
							the price. Similar to traditional collectibles like trading cards
							or sports memorabilia, NFTs with uncommon/low supply traits are
							typically in higher demand, which often increases the market
							value. If you own a signed, mint condition Michael Jordan rookie
							basketball card, it'll be worth more than a beat up Dennis Rodman
							card signed by Danny DeVito.
						</p>
						<p>
							Without easy access to these stats, it can be very hard to
							accurately value an NFT, especially when collection supply gets
							into the thousands. Deep Fungible Value provides a free and easy
							way to gauge NFT rarity within a collection.

					<h1 className="how-it-works-header">üßÆ Attribute Rarity Scoring</h1>
					<div className="how-it-works-content">
						<p>
							To find the rarity of an NFT, you start by evaluating all of the
							traits in that collection. Each trait is given a 'rarity score'
							based on how many NFTs in the collection have that trait and
							dividing it by the total number of NFTs in that collection. For
							collections with NFTs that have multiple editions, this total
							supply includes those edition counts.
						</p>
						<p>
							To remain unbiased, we have not taken any liberties to give a
							greater weight to certain traits/categories over others, even if
							they seem like they
							<em> should </em> be rarer. If you're affiliated with a GameStop
							NFT collection and would like to discuss custom rarity scoring,
							please{" "}

					<h1 className="how-it-works-header">üìà NFT Rarity Ranking</h1>
					<div className="how-it-works-content">
						<p>
							Once a rarity score has been calculated for each trait in a
							collection, a 'total rarity score' is given to each NFT by taking
							the sum of their trait's rarity scores. NFTs are then ranked
							within their collection based on that total rarity score. NFTs
							with the same total rarity score (typically only the case with
							1/1's) are marked as a tie.

							The goal was to create an optimal user experience while still
							maintaining an unbiased rarity ranking system. In other words, no
							assumptions as to the intentions of the creator(s) when it comes
							to rarity ranking, but we did hide some of the 'wonky'
							categories/traits from the filtering options to keep things clean.
