					<SectionHeader name="ðŸ§® Attribute Rarity Scoring" />
					<p>
						To find the rarity of an NFT, you have to start with the
						collection's traits. Each trait is given a 'rarity score' based on
						how many NFTs in the collection have that same trait (including
						multiple editions) and their proportion of the total collection
						supply.
					</p>
					<p>
						To remain un-biased, we have not taken any liberties to give a
						greater weight to certain traits/categories over others, even if
						they seem like they
						<em> should </em> be rarer. If you're affiliated with a GameStop NFT
						collection and would like to discuss custom rarity scoring, please{" "}
						<Link

				<hr className="my-4" />
				<div className="how-it-works-section">
					<SectionHeader name="ðŸ“ˆ NFT Rarity Ranking" />
					<p>
						Once a rarity score has been calculated for each trait in a
						collection, a 'total rarity score' is given to each NFT by taking
						the sum of their trait's rarity scores. NFTs are then ranked within
						their collection based on that total rarity score. NFTs with the
						same exact total rarity score (tyically only the case with 1/1's)
						are marked as a tie.

					<SectionHeader name="ðŸ”Ž Metadata Inconsistencies" />
					<p>
						There are some collections in GameStop's NFT Marketplace that have
						strange attribute data, like{" "}
						<a
							className="fw-bold text-decoration-none text-white"
							target="_blank"
							href="https://nft.gamestop.com/token/0x1d006a27bd82e10f9194d30158d91201e9930420/0x6185b585d72ed81b6ed733dc209ae276526186b77b3ff4c7ed72bb90121c4cc8"
						>
							this Metaboy
						</a>{" "}
						for example. Although this only affects a handful of NFTs, these
						collections may display inaccurate rarity rankings as a result. The
						goal was to create an optimal user experience while still
						maintaining an un-biased rarity ranking system. In other words, no
						assumptions as to the intentions of the creator(s) when it comes to
						rarity ranking, but we did hide some of the 'wonky'
						categories/traits from the filtering options on those collection
						pages to keep things clean. These collections have been marked with
						a yellow 'Metadata Note' on their respective page.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are affiliated with one of these collections, we'd love to{" "}
